    <h1>Sundial</h1>
    <p>From wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
    <p><b>A sundial measures time designs by the position of the sun.</b> The most commonly seen design such 
        as<br /> 'odinary' or standard garden sundial, casts shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of<br /> the day.
        As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However,<br /> the sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.</p> 
        <p>Most sundials design indicate apperant solar time.  Minor design veriations can measure standard<br /> and daylight saving time, as well.</p>
       <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Sundial in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) are <b>known from ancient<br /> Egypt,</b> and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek and Roman<br /> culture. A type of sundial without goomen is described in the old Old Testament(Isaiah 38:2).</p> 
        <p>The mathematician and astronomer Theodosrus of Bithynia (Ca, 160 BC-Ca, 100 BC) is said to have<br /> invented a universal sundial that could have anywhere on Earth.
        The French astronomer Orance<br /> Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovano Padovani pubblishe a<br /> treaties on the sundial 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of<br /> mural (vertical) and horizental sundials. Gluseppe Biancani's construction instrumenti ad horologia<br /> solaria discussed how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.</p>
        <h2>Installation of standerd sundials</h2>
        <p>Many ornmental sundial are designed to be used at 45 degree North. By tilting such a sundial, it<br /> may be installed so it will keep time. However some mass-produced garden sundials are</p>
